Team number (e.g., 01) : 24

#2 Student ID : 1566814 
#2 Student Name : Haiyu Yang

2. Meta-data page in an index file
- Show your meta-data page of an index design if you have any. 
    We allocate a page in the front of an index file with a root page number,
    Root page number: find the root page.

3. Index Entry Format
- Show your index entry design (structure).
    The index leaf entry design depends on the type of inserted attribute.
    If the inserted attribute is TypeReal:
        |Key|rid.pageNum|rid.slotNum|
    If the inserted attribute is TypeVarChar:
        |VarChar Length|Key|rid.pageNum|rid.slotNum|


4. Page Format
- Show your internal-page (non-leaf node) design.
    The structure of interior nodes(directory key) can be visualized as a sequence of alternating page pointers and keys.
    Left page pointer is used to find the left sibling internal node.
    |Non-Leaf Type Number 1|Number of Entries|Free Space Offset|Left Page Pointer
    |First Entry Pointer|2nd entry Pointer|3rd Entry Pointer|
    |Free space...|
    |1st Entry|2nd Entry|3rd Entry|

- Show your leaf-page (leaf node) design.
    The leaf nodes store the entries in the form of (key, RID). All leaf nodes are organized into a linked list
    of pages.
    Right page pointer is used to find the right sibling leaf.
    |Leaf Type Number 2|Number of Entries|Free Space Offset|Right Page Pointer
    |1st Entry Pointer|2nd entry Pointer|3rd Entry Pointer|
    |Free space...|
    |1st Entry|2nd Entry|3rd Entry|

5. Implementation Detail
- Have you implemented non-lazy deletion? Choose Yes or No: Also provide implementation details if yes.
    No

- Other implementation details:
    Insert into a b+ tree:
        Find the corrent leaf L, if L has enough space, done.
        Else, split L and copy up the middle key.
    Delete from a b+ tree:
        If L is half-full, done.
        If L has d-1 entries, try to re-distribute and borrow from siblings.
