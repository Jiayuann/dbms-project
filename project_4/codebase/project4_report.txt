1. Basic information
Team number (e.g., 01) : 24
#1 Student Name :  
#2 Student Name : 


2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (table, column, etc.). 
    The tuple value 
    (1) For INT and REAL: use 4 bytes; 
    (2) For VARCHAR: use 4 bytes for the length, followed by that number of characters.
    Index information:
    Names of the attributes, tables' name   
    If we scan, store get all matched tuple with our attribute name.
        
3. Index Nested-Loop Join
- Describe how your Index Nested-Loop Join works.
INLJoin is constructed with a Iterator and an IndexScan. 

-getNextTuple() keeps track of two loops (inner and outer) and returns tuples that 
equal within each other.
    It uses an index on the inner loop and not on the outer. 
    while loops is implemented to search for every matched value
	foreach tuple r in R do Use Index on S
	    foreach tuple s in S where ri == sj do
		    add <r, s> to result

4. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
    No.

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.
